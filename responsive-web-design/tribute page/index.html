			<p>Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914-2009) was an American agronomist, humanitarian, and Nobel laureate who has been called "The father of the Green Revolution." He is best known for developing high-yielding wheat varieties that helped to alleviate famine and poverty in developing countries.</p>
			<p>Borlaug was born in Cresco, Iowa, and earned a Ph.D. in plant pathology from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He worked in Mexico for many years, where he developed the semi-dwarf wheat varieties that are credited with saving millions of lives.</p>
			<p>Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply. He continued to work on agricultural issues throughout his life, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977.</p>
