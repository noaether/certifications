## Skills Used and Developed
- JavaScript: The projects are built using JavaScript, and require a good understanding of the language, including variables, data types, operators, functions, arrays, objects, and loops.
- Data Structures: The projects require a good understanding of common data structures, including arrays, objects, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- Algorithms: The projects require a good understanding of common algorithms, including searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming.
- Functional Programming: The projects require a good understanding of functional programming concepts, including higher-order functions, closures, immutability, and currying.

## Use Cases
The skills developed in this certification are useful in a variety of use cases, including:

- Developing complex applications with data structures and algorithms that require efficient processing of large datasets.

- Implementing complex functionality with functional programming that require immutability and higher-order functions.

- Writing and debugging robust code with automated testing that reduces the risk of errors and improves overall code quality.

- Optimizing code performance with profiling, algorithmic improvements, and other optimization techniques.

- Contributing to open source projects that require strong JavaScript skills, data structures and algorithms, and functional programming expertise.
